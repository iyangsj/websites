# OpenSSL

In OpenHarmony, the official does not provide out-of-the-box openssl capabilities, but this library exists as the basic capability of a large number of other basic capabilities. Therefore, we need to build the openssl library that can run on OpenHarmony ourselves. We provide basic pre-built products, supporting the following platforms.

- arm64-v8a
- armeabi-v7a
- x86_64

We provide some simple usage examples, which are based on the `reqwest` package. You can find them in the code [here](https://github.com/ohos-rs/example/tree/main/example/reqwest).
